# Feature Selection

What Is Feature Selection in Machine Learning?

The goal of feature selection techniques in machine learning is to find the best set of features that allows one to build optimized models of studied phenomena.

Types of Feature Selection Methods in ML:

Filter Methods

Information Gain

Chi-square Test

Fisherâ€™s Score

Correlation Coefficient

Variance Threshold

Mean Absolute Difference (MAD)

Dispersion Ratio

Wrapper Methods

Forward Feature Selection

Backward Feature Elimination

Exhaustive Feature Selection

Recursive Feature Elimination

Embedded Methods

LASSO Regularization (L1)

Random Forest Importance
